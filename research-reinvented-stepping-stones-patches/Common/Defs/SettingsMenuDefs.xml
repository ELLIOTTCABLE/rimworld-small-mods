            <tooltip>VFE - Classical uses a special mechanic by which you're intended to obtain its researches. As an alternative, however, it also provides extremely expensive, but neolithic, entries in the research-tree. If playing with a mod like "Semi-Random Research", this can be very annoying. Enabling this option will lock all of those special research items behind a single "Classical thought" node, allowing you to defer unlocking them (and polluting your Semi-Random Research rolls) until/unless you really need to.</tooltip>
